# Legacy Bomberman-Style Game

Welcome to the Legacy Bomberman-Style Game repository! This repository contains the decompiled source code and executable files of a 2D game I created using Unity, inspired by the classic Bomberman.

## Background

The original project files for this game were unfortunately lost. However, the executable files were preserved, and the code uploaded here is a decompiled version from those executables. This means the project is not in its original form and may lack some comments, structures, or conventions that were present in the initial implementation. Despite this, it serves as a legacy artifact of the game’s development.

## About the Game

This 2D game captures the spirit of Bomberman with a similar gameplay style. Players navigate through levels, placing bombs to destroy obstacles and enemies while avoiding being caught in the blast radius.

### Features:

* Classic Gameplay: Strategic bomb placement and evasion.

* 2D Graphics: Simple yet engaging visual design.

## How to Run

To play the game, you can use the included executable file:

1. Download the game executable 

2. Run the .exe file on a Windows system.

3. Enjoy the classic Bomberman-style gameplay!

> Note: Since the game is in a legacy state, compatibility with newer systems may not be guaranteed. If issues arise, consider running the game in compatibility mode or within a virtual machine.

## Controls

* In 'Home', Use the arrow keys to navigate and move the character within the game environment and press 'Space-bar' to set a bomb.

* In 'Game', Player 1 uses 'WASD' and 'Space-bar', Player 2 uses 'arrow keys' and '/'

## Limitations

* Decompiled Code: The uploaded code lacks some of the original structure and may include artifacts from the decompilation process.

* No Active Development: This project is no longer maintained, and no further updates are planned.

## Acknowledgments

* Unity: The game engine used for development.

* Bomberman: For inspiring this game’s design and gameplay mechanics.
